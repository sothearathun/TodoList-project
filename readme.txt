build an interactive to-do list application where users can add, remove, and mark tasks as completed
- input field for new tasks
- list of tasks with checkboxes to mark completion
- delete button to remove tasks
- save tasks in local storage
- show history of done tasks

## what i have learned from this
* variety usages of listner events
* dynamic relationships between parameters and functions 
* localstorage usage
* init function
